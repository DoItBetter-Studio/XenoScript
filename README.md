# XenoScript

XenoScript is a strongly-typed, bytecode-compiled scripting language built for secure, controlled modding environments.

It runs entirely inside a custom virtual machine and has **no direct access to the host system unless explicitly exposed by the developer**.

XenoScript is being developed for use in a custom game engine and is designed from the ground up to provide safe, predictable, and high-performance modding.

---

## ✨ Design Goals

XenoScript is not intended to be a general-purpose replacement for existing languages.  
It is a focused, domain-specific language engineered for one purpose: **safe, deterministic, and accessible modding**.

Only the virtual machine is embedded into the host application.  
Scripts, packages, and projects remain fully external — loaded from the filesystem, sandboxed, and isolated from the host unless explicitly granted capabilities. This separation is intentional: it ensures that modding remains open, transparent, and under the control of both the developer and the community, not hidden inside the engine or locked behind proprietary systems.

XenoScript's design emphasizes:

- **Strong static typing** for clarity and safety  
- **Deterministic bytecode execution** for predictable behavior  
- **Explicit module linking** to avoid hidden dependencies  
- **Controlled capability exposure** so the host decides what scripts can do  
- **No implicit system access** — nothing is allowed unless explicitly granted  
- **Predictable runtime behavior** through a minimal, well-defined VM  

XenoScript is built for environments where trust, safety, and determinism matter more than raw power.  
It is a language for creators, modders, and developers who want expressive scripting without sacrificing control or security.

---

## 🔐 Security Model

XenoScript runs inside a dedicated virtual machine.

By default, scripts:

- ❌ Cannot access the file system  
- ❌ Cannot perform HTTP requests  
- ❌ Cannot execute native code  
- ❌ Cannot access the host machine  

Capabilities must be explicitly exposed by the host application.

If a feature is not allowed, it simply does not exist in the VM.

This makes XenoScript ideal for secure modding environments.

## 🧠 Language Features

- Classes, single inheritance, interfaces, enums  
- **Erased generics** (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<K, V>`, user-defined generic classes) — distributed as compiled `.xar` binaries, no source shipping required  
- Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)  
- Virtual dispatch (`virtual` / `override`)  
- Nullable types (`string?`, `int?`, `??`, `!`, `?.`)  
- Exception handling (`try` / `catch` / `finally` / `throw`)  
- Events with static and **bound delegate** handlers (`EventName += this.method`)  
- `foreach` over arrays and any `IEnumerable<T>` implementation  
- Static fields and methods  
- `final` fields (compile-time immutability)  
- User-defined annotations with `@AttributeUsage` enforcement  
- Strongly-typed casting (`as` throws on failure)  
- Type checks (`is`, `typeof`)  
- Structured control flow (`if`, `for`, `foreach`, `while`)  
- String interpolation  
- Module imports and `.xar` package archives  
- Project model (`xeno.project`) with dependency resolution  
- Bytecode compilation (XBC v16) with linker stage

## 📦 Imports & Modules

```xeno
import <core>
import <collections>
import "local_file.xeno"
```

- `<name>` imports a package from the global package cache
(core stdlib, game-extended stdlib, or any resolved dependency `.xar`)  
- `"file.xeno"` imports project-local files (resolved from project root)  
- Circular imports are not allowed  

The standard library — including both the core language packages and the game's extended API — is embedded into the compiler, VM, packer, and LSP.
External packages are resolved from `.xar` archives at build time and loaded into the global package cache.

### Standard Library Packages

| Package | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `<core>` | `Exception`, `Attribute`, `IEnumerable<T>`, `IEnumerator<T>`, `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool` helpers |
| `<math>` | `Math` static class |
| `<collections>` | `List<T>`, `Dictionary<K,V>`, `Stack<T>`, `Queue<T>` |

## 🧩 Project Model

A `xeno.project` file defines a project:

```toml
[project]
name = "my_mod"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "My mod"

[dependencies]
utilities = "v3.5.1"
playerInteractions = "v1.2.0"
```

The compiler resolves dependencies from `.xar` archives and links them at build time.

XenoScript uses a layered standard library model:

- **Core standard library** — foundational language features (`core`, `math`, `collections`).  
  This layer is shared across games and embedded into the compiler, VM, packer, and LSP.

- **Game-extended standard library** — additional `.xeno` files written by the game developer.  
  Each game ships its own extended stdlib as a `.xar` archive, defining engine APIs, events,
  host-facing types, and helpers. This extended stdlib is treated as part of the standard
  library for that game and is embedded into the compiler, VM, packer, LSP, and the game
  itself. Each game ships its own XenoScript environment.

- **External mod packages** — community or project-local `.xar` files.  
  These live outside the game (for example, in a `/mods` directory) and are resolved from
  the project's dependency list. Mods are never embedded into the game; they remain external.

Every mod must define an entrypoint class annotated with `@Mod`.  
The current XenoScript toolchain (compiler, VM, and packer) is configured to look for
this specific annotation name when identifying a mod's entrypoint.

The `@Mod` attribute itself is defined in the game-extended standard library as a normal
XenoScript class derived from `Attribute`. The attribute supports both positional and
named arguments, with defaults provided by the game's implementation. Developers may
extend or modify the fields of this attribute as needed. While the structure of the
attribute is customizable, the annotation name (`@Mod`) is the default entrypoint
mechanism unless the toolchain is intentionally modified.

#### Positional arguments

```xeno
@Mod("my_mod", "1.0.0", "Author", "Description")
class MyMod {
    public:
        MyMod() {
            // entry point
        }
}
```

#### Named arguments (optional)

```xeno
@Mod("my_mod", version="1.0.0")
class MyMod {
    public:
        MyMod() {
            // entry point
        }
}
```

## 🎮 Intended Use

XenoScript is designed for:

- Game engines  
- Modding platforms  
- Controlled runtime scripting  
- Embedded VM environments  

Each game defines its own XenoScript environment through its extended standard library and exposed capabilities.
